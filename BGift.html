            <p>Even though I've known you for many years now, this is the first for me to be there for you on this day.</p>
            <p>Finally, I have this pleasure. So today, I want to tell you everything I wish for you and us.</p>
            <p>You have been the best company I've had during these years. We've spent a lot of time togetherâ€”laughed, sat upset, slept together, played together, and faced many problems together.</p>
            <p>These are all unforgettable memories that I'll carry with me gratefully all my life.</p>
            <p>So, I wish for you to never forget and I wish that you stay healthy. I wish to be with you always, and I wish that our friendship never ends.</p>
            <p>I wish you a good husband who loves you as much as you love him. I wish you a successful life and a happy future. I wish for us to meet one day, and I wish you to find a job that you love. Finally, and most importantly, I wish to stay close with Allah and meet together in Paradise.</p>
